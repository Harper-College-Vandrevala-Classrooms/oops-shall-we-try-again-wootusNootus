# Oops! Shall We Try Again? - Java Template

## Instructions

You can find the instructions for this lab [here](http://localhost:4000/teaching/csc/214/labs/oops-shall-we-try-again.html).

You only need to update `src/main/java/com/csc/Menu.java` with your implementation (other files can remain untouched). There are no automated tests for this problem since we have not learned any advanced testing strategies to handle the recurring input. Instead, you will test your code via a driver program.
